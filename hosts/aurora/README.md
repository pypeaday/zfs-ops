# Babyblue Aurora

This is my primary development machine.

There is a 2 TB SSD with a zpool on it named `tank`.

There is no playbook for this because I did'nt want to rewrite one to setup sanoid/syncoid on fedora and I tried using ubuntu busybox but with the systemctl integration it's not easy. so I just set it up manually [syncoid repo](https://github.com/jimsalterjrs/sanoid/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
